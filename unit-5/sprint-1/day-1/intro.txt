Compilation Vs Transpilation

Compilation =>

From High level language to Low level language
Low level usually is machine code (eg: binary) or bytecode
generated code is generally not human readable, it's for machine only
eg: C, C++ -> .exe
Transpilation

From high level language to high level language
Generated code is usually human readable
Generated code may need to go through one more compilation step
eg:
from const Heading =
Hello
to -> const Heading = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello")
eg:
from es6 const x = 1 to es3 var x = 1
Statically Typed vs Dynamically Typed

Dynamically Typed

Types are not known at compile time
Generally slower
JS, Python, Ruby
eg: const x = 1;
eg: const y = "hello";
Generally less safer
Statically Typed

Types are known at compile time
Generally faster than Dynamically typed
Generally Safer
C, C++, Go, Rust, Java, Typescript
eg: int x = 1
eg: string y = "Hello";
Typescript

Statically Typed
Just Javascript
Traspiles to JS
eg: const x: string = "hello";
eg: const y: number = 1;
const z: string = 10; // error
